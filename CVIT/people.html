Dr. Mazurowski is also a faculty in the Duke Medical Physics Program and a member of Duke Cancer Institute. His main research focus is on applications of machine learning including deep learning and statistical modeling as well as computer vision algorithms to medicine. The particular focus in terms of applications is medical imaging in the context of cancer treatment as well as understanding image interpretation process and error-making in radiology. One of the main research directions in Mazurowski lab is imaging-based cancer biomarkers and radiogenomics. Specifically, our focus is on predicting patient outcomes in breast and brain cancers (lower and high grade gliomas) as well as finding associations of imaging features with molecular subtypes and other genomic markers for these cancers. Another important research direction of the lab is development of human observer models that capture error-making patterns of the radiology trainees when they analyze medical images. The ultimate goal of this research is to reach a better understanding of decision and error making in radiologists and to construct an adaptive computer-aided education system for radiology.</p>

The  objective of his research is to assess how much radiation a worker or a patient  receives when being exposed to ionizing radiation – such as that found in a  medical diagnostic or radiotherapy procedure in a hospital. Dr. Ding is the  first to have developed a set to computational obese phantoms to help better  understand how radiation in CT scans affect the bodies of heavier people. Dr.  Ding&rsquo;s study was published as a &ldquo;FEATURE ARTICLE&rdquo; in the Physics in Medicine  and Biology and has received more &gt;14,000 times downloads and over 100 times  media attentions, including by <a href="http://on.wsj.com/HayzNv">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/MRgvNj">U.S. News</a>, and <a href="https://goo.gl/WC8H1g">HuffPost</a>.
