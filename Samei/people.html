I am currently working in research  in: image quality reference levels definition in CT, phantom image quality  prediction, and radiation risk metrics evaluation and definition. In the past I  also worked in radiation therapy (Cyberknife©) and in  radiopharmaceuticals (cyclotron manager). I have learned that, sometimes, a  problem's solution is not in a book, but instead in a night with wine and  blues.
