          <p align="left">Informatics has classically been focused on processing data and information, but in this era of performance- and value-based healthcare, a layer of analytics must be added. The Performance Informatics group designs, develops, and applies medical imaging metrologies to the clinical domain, from the aggregated enterprise-level all the way down to an individual patient exam. The projects undertaken by group members all apply radiation dose and image quality science in the context of patient imaging with the end goals being oriented toward understanding the sources of variability (individually and collectively) as means to improve the precision of clinical care. Characterizations of performance based on clinically-informed metrics and surrogates will be foundational for optimizing imaging for the clinical tasks. </p>
