  			<p>The mission of this group is to be a leading research-clinical consortium to advance the science and practice of precision medicine in imaging. We carry out this mission in five areas: dosimetrics, qualimetrics, performance informatics, virtual clinical trials, and quantitative imaging. By focusing on scientific rigor and clinical relevance, we strive to translate scientific developments into clinical practice with a patient-focused and patient-relevant performance metrology.

			<p class = "heading2" align="left" id="dosimetrics"><strong>Focus 1 – Dosimetrics</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of this focus is to devise and apply dose metrology that is patient-relevant and that is used for meaningful characterization, optimization, and assurance of precision care. Our goals are to develop a patient-specific organ dosimetry and examine supra-organ risk estimation. Current projects: DoseWatch, Estimation, Metrology. (<a href="#topresearch">back to top</a>)

			<p class = "heading2" align="left" id="qualimetrics"><strong>Focus 2 – Qualimetrics</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of this focus is to devise and apply quality metrology that is patient-relevant and that is used for meaningful characterization, optimization, and assurance of precision care. Our goals are to assess quality in the presence of texture, devise quality metrics that are not noise-limited, and define a metrology in the context of mathematical observer models and/or human perception.
			Current projects: Cardiac, Metrology, Dual-energy image quality metrology, Qualitation and optimization, metrology applications. (<a href="#topresearch">back to top</a>)

			<br>
			<p class = "heading2" align="left" id="informatics"><strong>Focus 3 – Performance Informatics</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of this focus is to apply the dose and quality science in the context of patient imaging, and to understand the sources of variability (individually and collectively) as a means to improve the precision of clinical care. Our goals are to devise patient based performance in clinical data, drive toward d’ informatics validated against observer data, and towards organ dose informatics. Current projects: Trials, Image quality metrology, translational applications. (<a href="#topresearch">back to top</a>)
			</p>
			<br>
		  <p class = "heading2" align="left" id="vct"><strong>Focus 4 – Virtual Clinical Trials </strong></p>
			<p>The objective of this focus is to devise and apply virtual clinical trials using anthropromorphic anatomical and functional models such that imaging methods can be reliably and efficiently be tested and optimized. Our goals are to use XCAT-based characterization and optimization, produce an accurate and efficient CT simulator, create textured XCAT models with perfusion capabilities and generate virtual cardiac models. Current projects: heterogeneity, CT simulation, Recon simulation, modeling, perfusion/contrast, population based heart models, applications. (<a href="#topresearch">back to top</a>)

			<br>
			<p class = "heading2" align="left" id="#quantitative"><strong>Focus 5 – Quantitative Imaging </strong></p>
			<p>The objective of this focus is to devise and apply quantitative methods to enhance the evidence-based practice of imaging in medicine. Our goals are to generate truth-based lesion models, produce truth-based databases for quantitative validation, and define a metrology for lesion quantification. Current projects: Trials, Resources, Texture, Morphology, Lesion, Resolution/Estimation. (<a href="#topresearch">back to top</a>)
